## End to End Machine Learning Project

In my project on predicting student math scores, I utilized Python and various machine learning techniques to
analyze demographic and academic factors. The project began with data preprocessing steps, including One-Hot
Encoding for categorical variables and Standard Scaling for numerical features. This ensured that the data was
properly prepared for modeling.

I explored a range of regression algorithms, each offering unique insights into predicting academic performance:
Linear Regression achieved an impressive 87.92% accuracy, demonstrating robust prediction capabilities with a
RMSE of 5.4212 on the test set.

Lasso Regression and Ridge Regression improved upon this foundation, showcasing different strategies to
enhance model performance, with RMSEs of 6.5197 and 5.3904, respectively, on the test set.
Decision Tree Regressor showed potential for overfitting but provided insights into feature importance and
achieved an RMSE of 8.1037 on the test set.

Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and AdaBoost regressors each contributed unique strengths, balancing
accuracy and interpretability across different performance metrics.
The project highlights the critical role of model selection and evaluation in predicting academic outcomes based
on diverse student demographics. Through rigorous evaluation using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE),
RMSE, and R2 Score, I optimized model performance and gained valuable insights into factors influencing
student success.

This work not only enhances our understanding of predictive modeling in education but also underscores the
importance of data-driven insights for educational interventions and policy decisions.
